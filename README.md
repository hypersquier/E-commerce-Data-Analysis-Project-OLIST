# Olist E-commerce Performance Analysis Project

## Overview
This project delivers a deep and comprehensive analysis of the Brazilian E-commerce Public Dataset (Olist). The primary focus is on evaluating sales performance, product trends, and the efficiency of logistics operations. We leveraged the scalability and power of Google BigQuery for complex SQL data processing and built a dynamic, interactive dashboard using Power BI to translate raw data into actionable business insights.
## Features and Analysis
- Data Transformation (ETL): Cleaning and integrating eight disparate e-commerce tables (orders, customers, items, products, sellers) for a unified view.
- Financial Performance Analysis: Tracking revenue trends, total sales, and profitability over time.
- Logistics Efficiency: Calculating the Average Delivery Time and analyzing order fulfillment success rates.
- Product Segmentation: Identifying and ranking the Top-Selling Product Categories by revenue.
- Geographic Analysis: Mapping sales distribution to determine the core customer markets.
- Dashboard Design: Building a robust data model and interactive visualizations in Power BI.

## Technologies Used
- Google BigQuery: The primary platform for handling and querying large datasets (Big Data).
- SQL (Standard SQL): Used for advanced data cleaning, complex table joins, and calculating crucial analytical metrics.
- Power BI: The core tool for visualization, data modeling, and developing interactive reports.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used to create custom key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the Average Order Value (AOV).

## Key Performance Indicator (KPI)
- Total Revenue: The overall financial value generated by analyzed sales.
- Total Orders: The count of unique transactions processed.
- Average Order Value (AOV): The mean expenditure per order, calculated using a custom DAX measure (SUM(Price) / DISTINCTCOUNT(Order ID)).
- Average Delivery Time: The mean number of days required to fulfill and deliver an order, a critical logistics metric.
